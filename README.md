Wikipedia search application 

The Wikipedia search application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple web-based tool that allows users to search for information on Wikipedia. 
Here's a summary of its key components and functionality:

User Interface (HTML/CSS): 
The application has a clean and visually appealing user interface. It includes a title, a search input field, a search button, and a container to display search results. The styling is done using CSS to enhance the overall look and feel of the application.

Search Functionality (JavaScript): 
The JavaScript code handles the search functionality. When the user enters a search term and clicks the "Search" button, the application makes a request to the Wikipedia API using Fetch API. The API returns a list of search results based on the user's query.

Displaying Results (JavaScript/HTML): 
The search results are dynamically displayed on the web page. For each result, the title and a snippet of the content are presented in a structured format. The results are appended to the designated container, and any previous results are cleared before displaying new ones.

Responsive Design (CSS): 
The application is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and styling for different screen sizes. This ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices.

Improvements and Considerations:
While this is a basic example, a production-level application would benefit from additional features such as error handling, pagination for large result sets, and a more sophisticated user interface. Additionally, in a real-world scenario, handling API requests on the server side might be considered for security reasons.
